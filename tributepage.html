            <h2>About</h2>
            <p class="para">
                Shivaji I (Shivaji Shahaji Bhonsale 19 February 1630 – 3 April 1680) was an Indian ruler and a member of the Maratha dynasty.
                 Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the Sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis of the Maratha Confederacy.
                 Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the Sultanate of Golconda, the Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers. 
                 Shivaji offered passage and his service to Aurangzeb to invade the declining Sultanate of Bijapur. 
                 After Aurangzeb's departure for the north due to a war of succession, Shivaji conquered territories ceded by Bijapur in the name of the Mughals.
                 Following the Battle of Purandar, Shivaji entered into vassalage with the Mughal empire, assuming the role of a Mughal chief and was conferred with the title of Raja by Aurangzeb. 
                 He undertook military expeditions on behalf of the Mughal empire for a brief duration.In 1674, Shivaji was coronated as the king despite opposition from local Brahmins. 
                 Praised for his chivalrous treatment of women, Shivaji employed people of all castes and religions, including Muslims and Europeans, in his administration and armed forces.
                 Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy.
                 Shivaji's legacy was revived by Jyotirao Phule about two centuries after his death. Later on, he came to be glorified by Indian nationalists such as Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and appropriated by Hindutva activists.

          Grandfather: Maloji Bhonsle, an influential general of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate. He was awarded the epithet of "Raja" for his services2.
         Father: Shahaji Bhonsle, a Maratha general who served the Deccan Sultanates and later the Mughal Empire.
          Mother: Jijabai, the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindhkhed, who claimed descent from the Yadav royal family of Devagiri.

                <h2>Conflict with Bijapur Sultanate</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1636, the Sultanate of Bijapur invaded the kingdoms to its south.The sultanate had recently become a tributary state of the Mughal Empire.It was being helped by Shahaji, who at the time was a chieftain in the Maratha uplands of western India. Shahaji was looking for opportunities of rewards of jagir land in the conquered territories, the taxes on which he could collect as an annuity.
                    Shahaji was a rebel from brief Mughal service. Shahaji's campaigns against the Mughals, supported by the Bijapur government, were generally unsuccessful. He was constantly pursued by the Mughal army, and Shivaji and his mother Jijabai had to move from fort to fort.[37]
                   Young Shivaji (right) meets his father Shahaji.In 1636, Shahaji joined in the service of Bijapur and obtained Poona as a grant. Shahaji, being deployed in Bangalore by the Bijapuri ruler Adilshah, appointed Dadoji Kondadeo as Poona's administrator. Shivaji and Jijabai settled in Poona.[38] Kondadeo died in 1647 and Shivaji took over its administration. One of his first acts directly challenged the Bijapuri government.
                  Independent generalship In 1646, 16-year-old Shivaji captured the Torna Fort through stratagem or bribery,taking advantage of the confusion prevailing in the Bijapur court due to the illness of Sultan Mohammed Adil Shah, and seized the large treasure he found there.[40][41] In the following two years, Shivaji took several important forts near Pune, including Purandar, Kondhana, and Chakan.
                  He also brought areas east of Pune around Supa, Baramati, and Indapur under his direct control.
                  He used the treasure found at Torna to build a new fort named Rajgad. That fort served as the seat of his government for over a decade.
                  After this, Shivaji turned west to the Konkan and took possession of the important town of Kalyan. The Bijapur government took note of these happenings and sought to take action. 
                  On 25 July 1648, Shahaji was imprisoned by a fellow Maratha sardar called Baji Ghorpade, under the orders of the Bijapur government, in a bid to contain Shivaji.
                 Map of Southern India .1605 Shahaji was released in 1649, after the capture of Jinji secured Adilshah's position in Karnataka. During 1649–1655, Shivaji paused in his conquests and quietly consolidated his gains.[43] Following his father's release, Shivaji resumed raiding, and in 1656, under controversial circumstances, killed Chandrarao More, a fellow Maratha feudatory of Bijapur, and seized the valley of Javali, near the present-day hill station of Mahabaleshwar.
                 The conquest of Javali allowed Shivaji to extend his raids into south and southwest Maharashtra. 
                 In addition to the Bhonsle and the More families, many others—including Sawant of Sawantwadi, Ghorpade of Mudhol, Nimbalkar of Phaltan, Shirke, Gharge of Nimsod, Mane, and Mohite—also served Adilshahi of Bijapur, many with Deshmukhi rights. 
                 Shivaji adopted different strategies to subdue these powerful families, such as forming marital alliances, dealing directly with village Patils to bypass the Deshmukhs, or subduing them by force.
                 Shahaji in his later years had an ambivalent attitude toward his son, and disavowed his rebellious activities.
                 He told the Bijapuris to do whatever they wanted with Shivaji.Shahaji died around 1664–1665 in a hunting accident.

                <h2 class="title">Conflict with the Mughals</h2>
                <p>
                    Until 1657, Shivaji maintained peaceful relations with the Mughal Empire. Shivaji offered his assistance to Aurangzeb, the son of the Mughal Emperor and viceroy of the Deccan, in conquering Bijapur, in return for formal recognition of his right to the Bijapuri forts and villages in his possession. 
                    Dissatisfied with the Mughal response, and receiving a better offer from Bijapur, he launched a raid into the Mughal Deccan.
                    Shivaji's confrontations with the Mughals began in March 1657, when two of Shivaji's officers raided the Mughal territory near Ahmednagar.[68] This was followed by raids in Junnar, with Shivaji carrying off 300,000 hun in cash and 200 horses.
                    Aurangzeb responded to the raids by sending Nasiri Khan, who defeated the forces of Shivaji at Ahmednagar. However, Aurangzeb's countermeasures against Shivaji were interrupted by 
                    the rainy season and his battles with his brothers over the succession to the Mughal throne, following the illness of the emperor Shah Jahan.

            <h2 class="title">Reconquest</h2>
            <p>
                The peace between Shivaji and the Mughals lasted until 1670, after which Aurangzeb became suspicious of the close ties between 
                Shivaji and Mu'azzam, who he thought might usurp his throne, and may even have been receiving bribes from Shivaji.
                 Also at that time, Aurangzeb, occupied in fighting the Afghans, greatly reduced his army in the Deccan; many of the disbanded 
                 soldiers quickly joined Maratha service.[102] The Mughals also took away the jagir of Berar from Shivaji to recover the money 
                 lent to him a few years earlier.[103] In response, Shivaji launched an offensive against the Mughals and in a span of four months 
                 recovered a major portion of the territories that had been surrendered to them.
                Shivaji sacked Surat for a second time in 1670; the English and Dutch factories were able to repel his attack, but he managed to 
                sack the city itself, including plundering the goods of a Muslim prince from Mawara-un-Nahr, who was returning from Mecca. Angered
                 by the renewed attacks, the Mughals resumed hostilities with the Marathas, sending a force under Daud Khan to intercept Shivaji on his return home from Surat; this force was defeated in the Battle of Vani-Dindori near present-day Nashik.
                In October 1670, Shivaji sent his forces to harass the English at Bombay; as they had refused to sell him war materiel, his forces blocked English woodcutting parties from leaving Bombay. In September 1671, Shivaji sent an ambassador to Bombay, again seeking materiel,
                this time for the fight against Danda-Rajpuri. The English had misgivings of the advantages Shivaji would gain from this conquest, 
                but also did not want to lose any chance of receiving compensation for his looting their factories at Rajapur. The English sent Lieutenant Stephen Ustick to treat with Shivaji, but negotiations failed over the issue of the Rajapur indemnity.
                 Numerous exchanges of envoys followed over the coming years, with some agreement as to the arms issues in 1674, but Shivaji was never to pay the Rajapur indemnity before his death, and the factory there dissolved at the end of 1682.
